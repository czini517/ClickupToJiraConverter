story,,qndku,Android keystore file management with API,"Use case(s)\\ We have an endpoint that we can use to create and upload a keystore file to the Android keystore file section of our Code Signing tab. But discovered that we are missing endpoints that are related to confirm upload, update, delete and list a specific file. (So far we've been using the generic file storage ones for the same actions...?)\\ How it should work for the user\\ Some endpoints are missing in our Swagger docs and hence from our Devcenter documentation:\\ confirm a file upload\\ update an uploaded file (attributes)\\ delete\\ getting a specific file's data \\ As discussed with @bekesi gergely, there is no need for a listing endpoint since  users can only upload one keystore file. But we might need an endpoint to get the uploaded file's data.\\ \\ Based on the created new endpoints, Swagger and Devcenter will be updated.\\ Additional resources/research (optional)\\ ",estimation,03/Apr/19 11:03 AM,,,,3,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,android,api,backend,enhancement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
task,,9g1un,"Make the bg worker deployer faster, ideally under 5 mins","Creator checklist\\ Have you set a priority?\\ Have you set the correct Location?\\ What should we do?\\ The website bg worker deployer now takes ~15-18 mins to complete, we should reduce that time as much as possible.\\ \\ There are a few low hanging fruits, e.g. to NOT to call ""quiet"" and ""stop"" on the bg workers separately, but do it in batches. Explanation: right now every single sidekiq worker is quieted & stopped **via heroku cli** rake command. This means ~1 mins to boot that one-off heroku command, for every single heroku run rake.. command.\\ \\ We should reduce the number of heroku run rake commands as much as possible, e.g. group these calls and provide a list of workers/hosts instead of calling it for every how separately.\\ \\ Back when we missed that the heroku api token wasn't set properly in the bg worker and the heroku run calls were all just skipped the actual total time was ~5-6 mins, so we could get close to that just by reducing the heroku run calls.\\ Why should we do it?\\ 15 mins for every single deploy is insanely long, and can even generate a significant bg task queue during that time.\\ \\ Getting close to 5 mins would allow faster deploy iterations, e.g. faster rollback!\\ How can you help?\\ Happy to help with anything ;)\\ ",ready to sprint,17/Oct/18 12:07 PM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,10800,backend,maintenance,monolith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"04/Apr/19 11:26 AM;jozsef.eros@bitrise.io;Let's only deal with the described low hanging fruit for now.

A quote pulled directly from the Butter CMS implementation tutorial, which seems relevant:\\ ""Our blog is set up, but crawlers from search engines and social networks don't always execute Javascript so our blog has terrible SEO.""\\ \\ From the Butter CMS documentation, the solution seems to be using server-side or pre-rendering. I'm sure you can figure that out better than I can though. As long as Google actually sees a page with the content a user would see as well, our problem is solved.\\ Description\\ Please implement a mechanism that allows Google to index the page:\\ www.bitrise.io/integrations/\\ How it should work for the user\\ (assuming the Google crawler is the user)\\ I crawl through Bitrise.io, run into a link to the step library, visit www.bitrise.io/integrations/ and find a bunch of articles + links to those articles on the page\\ I happily resume my crawling\\ Key Results that need to be tracked\\ https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch should show fully rendered pages for all pages involved\\ Additional resources / research (optional)\\ This is currently really really (really) hurting our search traffic for the pages involved. The Devcenter has static pages and does more organic traffic than www. and blog. combined, while the blog has 10x the amount of content\\ \\ Investigation findings\\ Google CAN execute Javascript and which can potentially ruin the server rendered website. The problem seems to be is that it uses chrome 41 which has missing support for some features (namely for the steps page Object.entries ). Also caching is a browser feature, it has to be manually implemented for parts that can run in node as well.\\ \\ To make it easier to implement the feature, you can download a chrome 41 package from here:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xAgSsZ0uRoMo6QGJBF1BdPxtETBpwXcT. After extracting it, you should run the chrome.sh script in it, which should start chrome 41. You have to use the script every time, otherwise the auto update would throw out the old version. It's not exactly elegant, you can expect some weird behaviour.\\ ",ready to sprint,28/Nov/18 3:19 PM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,18000,enhancement,frontend,growth,notify:user,team-kata,webapp,,,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/6cf2683e-c44d-4e4b-b2b2-59c64da356fd/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%2013.58.49.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/May/19 2:12 PM;kata.keri@bitrise.io;please check this for estimation

The side effect is that every [merge request event](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/integrations/webhooks#merge-request-events) received with the [""`state`"" of `""opened""` or `""reopened""`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-webhooks/blob/67df993abfc6728dd8478805358e0eecee4c35f3/service/hook/gitlab/gitlab.go#L138) is passed along to workflows' pull request triggers regardless of the relevance of the actual `""action""` appearing in the payload. This in turn can clog build queues and waste lots of precious time and money for any Bitrise user that hosts their projects on GitLab. 💸\\ \\ To fix this, I've added some additional logic that checks the merge request ""action"" (along with the ""state""), and skips event propagation accordingly.\\ \\ Specifically, this adds the following updates to hook logic for merge requests:\\ \\ * Checks `action` and skips irrelevant updates\\ * Adds a `merge_status` check to skip non-mergeable branches\\ \\ Also:\\ \\ * Updates links to official GitLab webhook docs\\ * Some other very minor cosmetic/pedantic changes\\ \\ Closes [gh-81](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-webhooks/issues/81).\\ Pull Request link\\ https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-webhooks/pull/82\\ \\ ",Closed,14/Feb/19 11:35 AM,,,,1,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,enhancement,pull_request,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"05/Mar/19 8:36 AM;gergely.bekesi@bitrise.io;Discuss it with Tooling

Email:\\ \\ Recurly’s API is critical to merchant success. We provide new API and client library releases continuously in order to provide access to new features, improve performance, and fix bugs. Because Recurly is a financial application, we also update our APIs and clients to ensure security.\\ In order to maintain a level of high quality, we are putting in place a policy to deprecate and decommission API versions and client libraries.\\ The policy we have put in place is:\\ To deprecate HTTP API versions and client libraries 2 years after they become available.\\ Deprecation means that Recurly will no longer support, provide bug fixes, or patch security issues for these API versions or client libraries.\\ To reach the end of life of HTTP API and client library versions 6 months after deprecation.\\ End of life means that these API versions and client libraries will no longer function.\\ For Official Client Library Users\\ As someone who is using a Recurly officially supported client, you must upgrade to a version which uses the Recurly HTTP API v2.7 or above by October 1, 2019. The version of the client you use is independent of the HTTP API's version so we have provided you with a list of minimum client versions below.\\ Although we are providing the minimum version here, we strongly suggest you upgrade to the latest version and practice keeping the library up to date. We will continue to deprecate API versions 2 years after their initial release.\\ Ruby\\ Upgrade to 2.10.5 or above\\ https://dev.recurly.com/page/ruby-upgrade-guide\\ Python\\ Upgrade to 2.6.3 or above\\ https://dev.recurly.com/page/python-upgrade-guide\\ PHP\\ Upgrade to 2.8.2 or above\\ https://dev.recurly.com/page/php-upgrade-guide\\ .NET\\ Upgrade to 1.6.3 or above\\ https://dev.recurly.com/page/net-upgrade-guide\\ Java\\ Upgrade to 0.11.0 or above\\ For users directly calling the HTTP API or using an unofficial client\\ If you are not already doing so, you must provide a header value `X-Api-Version` in all requests to the V2 API. If you are already doing so, you must now provide the value 2.7 or above. More about versioning can be learned from the versioning section of our documentation.\\ Although we are providing the minimum compatible version, we stronglysuggest you upgrade to the latest version and practice keeping it up to date. We will continue to deprecate API versions 2 years after their initial release.\\ You may not need to address every change in the API, but you will likely be affected by some of the breaking changes when upgrading your application. To understand what is changing between your current version and the version you wish to upgrade to, see the API Release Notes section of our documentation.\\ If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team.\\ The Recurly Team\\ \\ ",estimation,08/Feb/19 1:56 PM,"9/1/2019, 4:00:00 AM GMT+2",,,3,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"08/Feb/19 1:58 PM;viktor.benei@bitrise.io;Older versions will stop working after October 1, 2019

task,,wwk8a,Ask Recurly for data transfer,"What should we do?\\ We ask Recurly for a data transfer to Stripe, and then get in touch with Stripe and let them know too. Stripe will import our customer payment details (such as credit cards and bank account information for ACH and SEPA payments) and billing address information. Stripe cannot, however, import any subscriptions—these need to be re-created separately - (but this will be handled with STEP 2 and STEP 3-see cards:     ).\\ Why should we do it?\\ This is STEP 6 in our epic- Migrate to Stripe. With this step all credit cards and bank account informations, and billing addresses about every user and org will be transferred to Stripe. \\ More details\\ Email from Stripe about data transfer:\\ ""As a first step, please reach out to your current processor and request a data export to Stripe. We've imported data from Recurly before so this should be a fairly straightforward process.""\\ You can find a more detailed description of the steps involved in migrating in our documentation[0]. We can only import payment details and billing information, not payment history or subscriptions. Subscriptions will need to be recreated using our API. This can be done by creating the appropriate pricing plans, and then adding subscriptions with proper arguments to your customer objects. Specifically you'll need a list that has each active subscription, the next billing date, the pricing plan, and the customer that subscription is associated with. From there you can loop over the list, and add a new subscription to each customer--passing the next billing date for billing_cycle_anchor, and prorate=false to be sure your customer isn't billed incorrectly. I also recommend reading through these references as well[1].\\ \\ Lastly, we also need to verify the Stripe account into which you want us to import the card details by following these steps:\\ \\ 1/ Log into your dashboard as the account owner or other team member\\ 2/ Navigate to our support form[2] and send us an email with the subject line ""Attention Migrations Team - Ticket #7055250"". In the body of the message, state that you approve importing data into this account.\\ \\ Once you've sent the verification message, reply to this email so that I can look for it and verify your identity.\\ \\ Email from Recurly about the data transfer:\\ Recurly will provide a free, one-time export of your credit card data to Stripe. There are several steps to this process, which I've outlined below:\\ Please identify the date (even if approximate) of your export. This helps us schedule the work with our engineering team\\ Begin processing all new billing through your new provider (to prevent any accidental new signups during the export process)\\ Disable all emails\\ Optional: terminate all subscriptions; this will preserve all data with the exception of status and expired_at fields\\ Disable your payment gateway inside of Recurly\\ Under Configuration, click Payment Gateways\\ For each active gateway: Click Edit\\ Uncheck the Enabled for new transactions box\\ Click Update Payment Gateway.\\ 6. Export any needed information (such as account, subscription, or invoice data) from inside your Recurly account\\ You can expect the export to be completed within 3 business days of receiving all the above information. Once the export is completed, you should close your Recurly site as soon as possible to avoid incurring additional transaction fees. Recurly charges a $2,500 export fee above and beyond the initial free export if any additional exports are needed, so we like to do this for you in one go!\\ \\ Additional details:\\ Do not email or otherwise send sensitive credit card details or customer information directly to Stripe. If you have this data, please get in touch so we can help you securely transfer your data.\\ It can take between a few days and several weeks for your previous processor to transfer the final data to Stripe, so make sure to allow for this transition time in your migration plan. If the data we receive can’t be used, we will outline any issues and work with your previous processor to correct the data.\\ After your previous processor transfers your data, Stripe begins importing it into your account. Stripe creates a Customer for each unique customer in the transferred data file, and creates and attaches the customer’s cards as Card or Source objects. If the transferred data indicates the customer’s default card, we set that as the customer’s default payment method for charges and subscription payments.\\ This import process usually occurs within 10 business days of receiving complete and correct data from your previous processor.\\ \\ \\ \\ ",Open,14/May/19 2:09 PM,,,,1,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,epic:_migrate_to_stripe,maintenance,team-kata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

```
Hi Viktor, 

Sorry for the tardy response, I was out on Friday. Aggregate invoices works to consolidate more than one subscription renewal on the same invoice, if the renewal datetimes match exactly. Aligning renewals has to do with when the subscriptions on the account will renew, so will establish a bill date on the account, and all subs added to that account will be forced to align and renew on the bill date. Typically, if you are aligning the renewal dates you will also want all of the subscriptions to appear on the same invoice when the renewal date arrives, but it's not a requirement.

I've modified your sandbox account: https://bitrise-test.recurly.com and enabled the following features for you to test: Aggregate Invoices, Aligning Renewals, and Allow multiple subscriptions in purchase. 

Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions!

","26/Nov/18 3:40 PM;viktor.benei@bitrise.io;For subscription alignment, so that we only generate a single Invoice for a given account even if we have multiple subscriptions for that account, Recurly recommends Calendar Billing right now: https://docs.recurly.com/docs/calendar-billing#section-alignment

Calendar Billing indeed seems to provide a reasonable solution (workaround), though there are a few questions we have to get an answer for:

What happens if there's an Annual and a Monthly subscription, how will the alignment work in that case? Based on the documentation I'd expect these to be invoices separately (what we want) but it isn't stated explicitly, only for collection method (`Collection method: subscriptions in an aggregate invoice must all share the same collection method (either all manual or automatic). Subscriptions that do not share the same collection method will invoice separately.`)
Payment method: what if the main subscription is not a credit card based but a wire-transfer one? - based on the documentation I'd expect to have two separate invoices, which is fine given we only accept wire-transfer based billing for annual plans.

When that person leaves the company, the person managing the org should update it, no?
","03/Jan/19 2:57 PM;daniel@bitrise.io;@Hendrik Haandrikman Just a couple of questions regarding this:
Would the person creating the org be the best to determine who this person might be?
What happens if that person leaves the company?
Would it be better if we asked for the title of a person signing up to better map the org chart? Self claiming usually works better and more accurate than appointing someone to be the point of contact.

bug,,u4c3j,"Resolve ""stuck"" connections/frequent high response times/increased error rate, which makes the UI really hard to use (e.g. require multiple page reloads to load every part of the page).","Actual Behaviour\\ Lately we started to see frequent high response times, when certain connections get stuck.\\ When this happens 99p response times goes up to 30 seconds (which is the Heroku built in request timeout, after this the Heroku router cancels the request/terminates the connection) and remains there until the dynos are restarted, causing increased error rates. Or in another recent case p95 response time went to >5 seconds and that started to cause increased error rates.\\ \\ This leads to elevated levels of 5xx errors, which means part of the UI does not load or that you have to reload the page multiple times.\\ \\ What seems to happen is that certain requests start to take a very long time, which blocks that dyno. Heroku's router isn't really clever to resolve these, it's a simple round-robin router, so it'll keep routing requests to these affected dynos, but of course as those dynos are still working on the previous request they won't be able to serve the new ones.\\ \\ An important highlight/detail: we have a ""rack timeout"" gem in our Rails project but it seems that might not work properly, as if that would work it should terminate these requests before Heroku router would (so below 30 seconds).\\ Expected Behaviour\\ The high response time issue should be investigated and resolved, and with that the failing requests/part of the UI not loading should also be resolved.\\ Steps to Reproduce\\ Example:\\ https://bitfall.slack.com/archives/C5XLXLZ5Z/p1554143354000700\\  \\ DataDog's stats should show which endpoints are affected as well as Heroku metrics can show how frequently this happens. For the last 7 days:\\  \\ \\ One more from 2019.apr.24, this time the p95 increased to >5sec:\\ \\  \\ \\  \\ \\ Notes/things to try or check:\\ Check DataDog. We should have enough information there to identify what causes the issue. If we don't then we have to make sure we have the details there, as that's a significant purpose of the monitoring system.\\ ",estimation,24/Apr/19 7:39 AM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,backend,issue,team-kata,,,,,,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/1b586e16-56f1-4820-950d-c307a12f829e/Screenshot%202019-04-24%20at%208.03.50.png,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/ca31c363-48b9-4c37-97ed-c3246ef7a6d3/Screen%20Recording%202019-04-24%20at%207.33.28.mov,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/3116ec3c-df73-4b16-b6c1-285e129c1495/Screenshot%202019-04-24%20at%207.55.11.png,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/feb75134-877a-4da9-a74c-bd0ce3b5e7e8/Screenshot%202019-04-01%20at%2020.28.29.png,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/c9a5fe80-900b-48c2-85fc-8deec16e576a/Screenshot%202019-04-02%20at%2010.32.51.png,,,,,,,,,,,,"09/May/19 11:12 AM;kata.keri@bitrise.io;Dropping this to high because the issue is not present now.

story,,mzf5p,Add UI for the step timeout parameter - FE,"Description of the feature request\\ UI for the new step timeout parameter. The new timeout: step param should be exposed on the UI.\\ \\ I'd imagine this as a simple numerical input field as the timeout is: ""Number of seconds, specifying the longest/max time the step can run for."" If not specified it means there's no limit (this is the default), but with the timeout parameter you can say that Step A should not run longer than 10 seconds. If it would run for longer the step will fail, the same way as if it would run into an error (meaning, the step marked as failed and the next step starts, following the usual logic of what happens if Step A fails).\\ \\ You can set this on step level, so StepA can have a timeout of 10 seconds, StepB 5 seconds and StepC no limit at all, this is an independent option on every step.\\ Use case /what for or how would the user use it\\ From 1.9.0 bitrise version you can specify step's timeout property to restrict the step's max run time.\\ In the following bitrise.yml:\\ format_version: ""4""\\ default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git\\ \\ workflows:\\   timeout:\\     steps:\\     - script:\\         timeout: 5\\         inputs:\\         - content: echo ""This script is fast""\\     - script:\\         timeout: 5\\         inputs:\\         - content: echo ""sleep makes this script too slow :(""; sleep 10\\ \\ Original thread\\ Notify User: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-workflow-editor/issues/192\\ \\ \\ ",estimation,11/Mar/19 1:54 PM,,,,3,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,enhancement,feature_request,frontend,notify:user,workflow_editor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"27/Mar/19 9:36 AM;kata.keri@bitrise.io;Fixed design: https://zpl.io/a3eQQRQ

Just call the login command, which opens a browser window in which you click approve and the CLI tool is now logged in.\\ \\ Video attached.\\ \\ Additional resources/research (optional)\\ Technical flow:\\ A CLI tool could request a short lived ""auth callback"" token, which then can be opened in a browser. E.g. in case of Heroku when you run heroku login it opens a URL like this in the browser: https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/browser/2fdbb826-8d13-42b1-ac56-08f3be1792d9 \\ User on this page can approve or reject this authorisation request.\\ If user isn't signed in then s/he'll have to do the usual sign in, which can be e.g. via SSO/SAML.\\ If approved it will generate an expiring Personal Access Token (PAS), the same if user would have to manually register one.\\ This PAS can then be retrieved by the client who initiated the process for a limited time.

So in my case: I scheduled my trigger few months ago to 05:00 (AM) (in Europe/Warsaw timezone, which was GMT+1 then), now it is 06:00 (because currently there is a DST and offset changed to GMT+2). If I change my timezone to Asia/Tokyo it will be 13:00.

task,,df3hp,"Move Build Log handling to a separate microservice, to ease the strain on Website.","What should we do?\\ Do not store build logs/build log chunks in the main website DB. Instead create a separate Build Log (micro)service to handle everything Build Log related.\\ Why should we do it?\\ Build Log processing overloads the background worker system of the website. Moving it to a separate service would ease the strain on the main website DB, as well as it'll make it easier for us to iterate on the build log system in the future.\\ More details\\ Today every Build Log Chunk is:\\ \\ Received in the api.bitrise.io on an endpoint, from DEN.\\ Then put into Sidekiq/Redis for background processing.\\ Then the background processor puts it into the main website database.\\ Finally once the build is finished another worker collects the chunks and then moves them to Amazon S3.\\ \\ Proposed solution:\\ \\ Initially, to make the transition as easy as possible, still api.bitrise.io would receive the chunks from DEN.\\ But then instead of using the main website background processors the system would pass the log chunk to the Build Logs service (via a http api).\\ When fetching the build logs it should have to go through this BuildLogs service too, as no log chunks or any build log related functionality would remain in the main website.\\ This means that when the user wants to see the BuildLog that would still go through the main website, as the website handles the authentication & authorisation, but then in the background (after the authorisation) it would just call the BuildLog service where the actual implementation lives.\\ \\ Intermediate steps:\\ Once the new Build Log Service is ready to accept log chunks start sending it to it from the API but don't remove the current/legacy solution from it either , just in addition send the log chunks to Build Log Service.\\ Make sure that it won't cause any issues even if BuildLogService isn't available, e.g. send it in a goroutine async, after sending the response from the DEN hook handler - basically don't fail the request or anything even if the BuildLogService would fail.\\ Log any error of course, just don't fail the request as we'll still use the legacy system to fetch the logs.\\ If BuildLogService can handle the load and there's no error in receiving logs (it's deemed stable) start proxying requests of log chunk fetch to BuildLogService. Basically start to use BuildLogService in production to get logs, while the legacy system is still there and we can still switch back to using it.\\ If there's no issue and BuildLogService (BLS) can handle the load finish switching to use only BLS everywhere, e.g. even to Download the Log.\\ Final step is to remove the legacy system, leaving only BLS in production.\\ \\ Technical notes:\\ This first service separation should not include a major revision, the purpose is to have the related logic separated.\\ It should be able to handle past/finished builds, e.g. be able to download logs of a 6 month old build.\\ As discussed we'd still use a REST API, just like we do today, with only one new endpoint if possible: be able to get the log chunks during the build with pagination. This would allow the frontend to fetch the whole build log while the build is still running, instead of waiting until the archive is ready.\\ \\ A work-in-progress implementation can be found at https://github.com/bitrise-team/build-log-service which uses Amazon S3 directly for storing the log chunks, without any DB. The code is written in a way that should be extendable to include a DB if required.\\ \\ EDIT: that said for long term scalability it seems to be better to utilise an event/message stream, e.g. Google Pub/Sub + a lambda like system (e.g. knative eventing or GCP Functions) instead of handling the log chunk receiving in the Build Log API directly. That Build Log API should only pass it to Google Pub/Sub or similar event/message stream system and then an auto scaled consumer (Lambda, knative eventing, GCP Function, ...) should store it into either S3/GCS directly, or into an intermediate storage.\\ ",estimation,11/Dec/18 5:24 PM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23/Apr/19 6:56 PM;viktor.benei@bitrise.io;Update: added my architecture note updates to the end of the Technical notes section/card description.

task,,tde17,Investigation - UI testing with https://preflight.com,"What should we do?\\ Create a very simple UI testing setup using https://preflight.com to test the frontend before deploying on the UI side.\\ Create tests for these paths in the webapp for now\\ Landing page\\ Log in\\ Sign up\\ Integrations page\\ \\ This initial setup would then be extended with new test cases over time.\\ Why should we do it?\\ To prevent bad releases.\\ More details\\ The goal would be a minimal but fully working setup which performs UI tests before deploying into production.\\ \\ My discussion with endtest.io (who are also an option but preflight has a better UI/UX and easier to create tests) about how we could integrate a tool like preflight into our dev workflow:\\ \\ Overview of how our dev workflow looks like:\\ In short we spin up a Heroku ""preview app"" for every Pull Request as well as we run CI on every PR and every change. A PR can not be merged until all automated tests finish with success and a manual review is completed.\\ \\ Ideally we'd like to integrate a UI/browser testing into this flow, so that we run it as part of the CI process (either inside the CI environment or on the Heroku preview app, though first option would be preferred, the preview app is used mainly for manual QA/check). If it fails the PR can't be merged. If everything's successful (+ manual review) the PR is merged and deployed to prod automatically.\\ \\ Their response:\\ \\ That should be easy. It's a pretty standard scenario.\\ And you'll pass the variable for the environment directly as a parameter to the Endtest API call for starting the test execution.\\ The URL for your app being directly related to the environment on which your app is placed.\\ The Endtest API call for starting the test execution is the standard:\\ https://endtest.io/api.php?action=getResults&appId=[your app id]&appCode=[your app code]&hash=[the returned hash]&format=[json or html]\\ \\ Where you would add your own custom parameter, let's say $env\\ \\ So, it would become...\\ \\ https://endtest.io/api.php?action=getResults&appId=[your app id]&appCode=[your app code]&hash=[the returned hash]&format=[json or html]&$env=""dev3""\\ \\ The test would use that $env variable to choose the right URL from which to access your app.\\ And you will use the Endtest webhooks to communicate back, you can just configure those to reply back to your CI/CD with the JSON containing the results.\\ \\ Basically we'd prepare the tests on the service, then when we want to run them automatically from the CI build we can set an alternative URL for it, so that the test runs on ""preview-app.url"" instead of on ""bitrise.io"". This only works for apps where we have a per-PR preview app type environment, but that should be simple for the Heroku based apps, to get started with.\\ \\ Similar services/tools:\\ \\ https://www.cypress.io/\\ https://endtest.io/\\ https://preflight.com/\\ \\ ",ready to sprint,17/Apr/19 10:38 AM,,,,1,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,10800,frontend,maintenance,team-kata,webapp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"03/Jun/19 2:43 PM;zoltan.nyikos@bitrise.io;Please organize a discussion with POs and @Gabor Szakacs

story,,aq5cm,Open Workflow Editor on separate page,"What should we do?\\ Have a separate page for the Workflow Editor.\\ Why should we do it?\\ It could be separated both styling-wise and script-wise.\\ How can you help?\\ Key things to keep in mind:\\ \\ - Design concerns, since this whole change also changes the UX. Things to keep in mind:\\ 	- App breadcrumbs. They are currently outside the iframe, so if we were to drop the iframe, the breadcrumbs would need to be implemented inside the editor. This would not be a problem in local mode - we could hide the breadcrumbs there if we detect we're in ""website mode"" - so this concern is only about having to implement the breadcrumbs in the editor's code as well. Best approach would be copying it over from the website, which could work, some styling adjustments will probably be needed afterwards.\\ 	- Website header/footer. Currently we don't have them when the editor is open, but now that the editor would have its own page, the idea might come up to add them. It would not be a good idea, because without the iframe, everything that appears on the editor's page, needs to be implemented inside the editor. Which would mean needing to reimplement the website header and footer in the editor.\\ \\ - User redirection. Things to keep in mind:\\ 	- Back arrow would direct the user to the page where the editor was opened. This can either be the app page as a tab, or the build details page.\\ 	- If there are unsaved changes when reload/back/tabclose is triggered, the browser alertbox would come up.\\ \\ - Moving the editor to a new route. Things to keep in mind:\\ 	- An endpoint would be needed (/app/<slug>/workflow ?) which would render the workflow editor from the public assets folder. This way, the editor's code could stay in the public assets folder as before, but the URL itself would be app-specific, which would be useful for getting the app slug (instead of iframe messaging), and also it looks neater this way.\\ 	- In the editor's code, a helper method which is used for URLs (in config.rb from line 23, mode_dependant_asset_path) would need to be checked, because if the editor will be on a new route, it might need to be set differently.\\ 	- We should keep the old route functioning (/app/<slug>#/workflow). Since the anchor is not sent to the server, the redirection to the new URL in this case should be done on client-side.\\ \\ - Currently the Workflow Editor communicates with the website via iframe messaging (see _MainController.js.erb from line 431) that would need to be dropped. These messages are:\\ 	- Getting the app slug (""configure-app_slug-([a-zA-Z0-9]*)"", ""requestingConfiguration""). This could be fetched from the URL with a regex, because the editor would not be in an iframe, it would have direct access to the URL that has the app slug.\\ 	- Communicating whether the editor has unsaved changes or not (""doesWorkflowEditorHaveUnsavedChanges""). This would not be needed, since the editor itself would do the whole ""You have unsaved changes, are you sure?"" browser alertbox thing when the user tries to go back.\\ 	- Header minimization (""^shouldMinimizeHeader:(yes|no)$""). This would either need an alternative solution, or could be dropped altogether, depending on whether we would want to keep the breadcrumbs or not.\\ 	- Show/hide close button (""^shouldShowWorkflowEditorCloseButton:(yes|no)$""). Same as above: depends on the breadcrumbs - alternative solution or drop.\\ 	- Back button pressed in browser, on the initial tab of the editor (""backButtonPressedOnInitialWorkflowEditorPage""). This was used to close the editor in this case, this could be dropped since the back button would work how it is by default intended to do.\\ \\ - Cleanup:\\ 	- Editor wrapper template (editor.slim) would not be needed, nor the script file for the editor's modal (workflowEditor.js.erb) and the stylesheet (workflow_editor.scss).\\ 	- Remove workflow-editor directive selector from application.html.slim\\ 	- Update bitrise.yml in the umbrella repository, so it does not try to access workflowEditor.js.erb where the current version of the editor is referenced, instead alter it wherever it will be referenced after the changes.\\ ",Closed,09/Nov/18 11:29 AM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,,enhancement,frontend,team-kata,workflow_editor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/May/19 3:00 PM;kata.keri@bitrise.io;tasks created with WFE migration tag.

@József Erős 
","09/Nov/18 11:39 AM;jozsef.eros@bitrise.io;This is a follow-up to the card 8md56  as it turned out to be not implementable. It has been approved by @Daniel Balla as over the time it seems to be the only alternative to using iframe.

Questions that need to be answered before this could be estimated properly:
Would this editor on the separate page, need to have the app breadcrumbs on the top? It is not problematic to implement it, it would be in the Workflow Editor's code, tied to the condition to only appear when opened on the website.
Would it need to have the website's header and footer? This one would be quite problematic, since if in this solution we do not want any iframe magic, just loading the Workflow Editor's page itself, this would mean having to reimplement the website header and footer in the Workflow Editor's code.

code signing wizard html template
app/views/job/show.json.jbuilder

Is used at:

BuildConfigCtrl.js -> $scope.startBuild
BuildConfigCtrl.js -> $scope.scheduleBuild
BuildConfigCtrl.js -> $scope.normalizedBuildPayload
BuildsCtrl.js -> $scope.loadBuildSchedules
BuildsCtrl.js -> $scope.triggerNowScheduledBuild
CreateAppProjectBuildConfigCtrl.js -> function projectBuildConfigSet
Build.js.erb -> startNewBuild
Build.js.erb -> startNewBuildWithSameParameters
BuildSchedule.js -> post
BuildSchedule.js -> delete

Needed code change:

RepositorySchedulerController: make authorization available not only with build trigger token
Build.js.erb -> startNewBuild: use user auth token instead of build trigger token
BuildConfigCtrl.js -> $scope.normalizedBuildPayload: modify the cURL request (in the .html template) to work with this payload even if it does not include the build trigger token. Use user auth token instead.
Remove build trigger token from templates & scripts mentioned above

First we need to see how website is pushing code live to identify areas where we could improve. It's difficult to tell before taking it apart. 

One idea would be (and it's somewhat irrelevant to this card) to implement a dynamic vulnerability scan on the website before pushing to live to see if we introduced a new easily detectable vulnerability.  It could also be just improvement in the process how to make it more secure.

When creating additional groups, the user can either tie a role to that group or leave it as a simple wrapper (current functionality). This would make the new version backward compatible for existing orgs.

Could a user disable this for those pre-created groups? I think it's a good idea to have a sane default (auto assign) when creating an Org, but that should not limit flexibility.

What would be the user flow for an org who starts to onboard a second team and so they'd like to stop the original groups being assigned to every app, as they'll now have two separate ""projects"" e.g. Website and Infra inside Bitrise, where we have separate admins in Website and in Infra.

story,,h60vq,Investigate: Per workflow file (overwrite) - e.g. for multiple Keystore files,"Allow uploading multiple (e.g. keystore) files. Why? E.g. in case of the Keystore file, the file has a URL, passwords etc. These variables are wired into the steps, so when you upload the first keystore file you don't really have to configure anything else, just upload the file and have the steps in the workflow. When you want to use a second keystore in a second workflow right now you have to define every single variable manually and re-configure the steps to use that, as the steps are configured to use the $BITRISE_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_X type env vars, but right now only one file can expose these.\\ \\ My suggestion would be to allow uploading multiple keystore files and marking one as the ""default"" (the first one), and the other ones with specific workflow(s), so e.g. when WorkflowB runs that will use keystore2 instead of the default one.\\ \\ In short, one keystore file would be the ""default"", and further ones could be uploaded to **overwrite** the default **for specified workflows**.\\ \\ Related: https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/two-different-environments-workflows-auto-generated-after-the-add-new-app-process/1736\\ \\ Requested by Enterprise customers:\\ EPAM\\ ",ready to sprint,05/Feb/19 1:44 PM,,,,2,Website,Engineering,Backlogs,10800,design,devcenter,enhancement,feature_request,frontend,team-kata,workflow_editor,,12/Jun/19 2:53 PM;Admin;https://attachments.clickup.com/9160e9cf-7043-4581-8071-8aae61f06faa/1736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30/May/19 5:12 PM;kata.keri@bitrise.io;Turned this into an investigation card.

","05/Mar/19 9:17 AM;jozsef.eros@bitrise.io;Agreement: we should use the mentioned JSON API, only for errors for now.

It should be an errors key, value an array of errors.
Each error should have a source, value either referencing the corresponding input field (if there is any) like { ""pointer"": ""/data/attributes/firstName"" }, or if there is no corresponding input then { ""pointer"": """" }.
Each error should have a code, value a compact, matchable string referencing the error, like taken.
Each error should have a detail, value a pretty sentence with capital initial, and closing dot, like Username is already taken..

For the FE to be able to easily distinguish endpoints using this convention, from older endpoints, we should set Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json for these responses on the BE. The FE can check this and handle the response accordingly.
","04/Mar/19 2:56 PM;jozsef.eros@bitrise.io;Add results of discussion.
","03/Mar/19 8:08 PM;gabor.szakacs@bitrise.io;Talking about validation errors I think the attribute that caused the issue must be included in a symbolized way so the FE can highlight the invalid field on a long input form. (If we returned pretty error messages only, it would be hard to parse the attribute from it.)

I suggest we use an existing spec for error msg format to avoid bikeshedding. E.g. the JSON API seems like a good candidate (maybe use the title as an identifier for the error, eg. too short wrong format

By the Website Team:
""I think it is due to unestimatable build percent. We estimate it based on the duration of the last successful build with the same workflow. Is it possible that these specific builds run workflows that did not have a successful build yet?""

After the first success build for the specific workflow it was working fine.

So I'm closing this ticket.
