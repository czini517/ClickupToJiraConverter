```
Hi Mia,

Sure, I'm happy to help!

> We recently added a public submodule to our android project and builds have started failing. I read this document https://devcenter.bitrise.io/faq/adding-projects-with-submodules and successfully created a new private test job with ssh keys, which I then added to our github CI user and all seemed to work fine. However, when I tried to replicate the same thing with a public job under the DuckDuckGo organization, I ran into problems.

Indeed there's a significant difference between private and public apps: Public Apps can't have SSH keys for security reasons, to not to expose the key.

I scheduled an update for the devcenter article you linked, but in short you should do the opposite of what's described in the guide: replace all git URLs in your submodule definition from GIT url to HTTPS. Reason: git clone with an SSH git clone url, even if the target repository is a public one, requires an SSH key. HTTPS git clone urls on the other hand do not require any authentication if the target is a public repository.

Based on this build: https://app.bitrise.io/build/79056b9b1a8dd54c

I'd suggest you to replace git@github.com:duckduckgo/bloom_cpp.git in your main repository's (https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android.git) submodule definition with its HTTPS equivalent: https://github.com/duckduckgo/bloom_cpp.git

If you have any other submodule with a `git@` / SSH git clone URL in the submodule definition please replace those with the HTTPS ones too.

That's all, as https git clone urls don't require authentication in case of public repositories you don't have to do anything else, no ssh key nor any other authentication is required :)

...

Let me know how it goes or if you'd have any questions!
Best,
Viktor

Krisz's response to the above question: ""Fastlane will remain in the attached image, since it will be detected and handled in the way that we generate config for it. But it will not be treated as a separate project type.

So if you choose Fastlane in the attached list your project type will be either other, ior or android
So based on this probably you do not need to modify the devcenter as

```Setting up configuration

After Setting up the SSH key for your project, Bitrise will download your code to make sure it can access the repository and will run an automatic repository scanner script to find the best initial configuration for your project. Currently Bitrise will detect iOS, Android, Xamarin, Ionic, Cordova, Flutter, React Native and fastlane projects out of the box.```

This is still true, Fastlane project will be detected.
But in the step selector and as a project type icon and from the project type selector it will be removed.""

story,,q9krp,Extend the Flutter Getting Started guide with iOS Code Signing related section.,"Use case(s)\\ While I was working on my Tokyo Flutter meetup sample I realised that a few steps are missing from the https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-flutter-apps/ Getting started guide.\\ \\ Namely, that after you generate a flutter project (with flutter create myapp ) you'll have to open the generated iOS Xcode project/workspace file and set a **Team** in project settings. Without this codesigndoc won't be able to collect the files for the project, as well as regardless of what kind of code signing setup you do on bitrise.io it'll fail as Xcode itself will complain about the project being invalid ( **Team** ID is required since Xcode 9 or 10 ).\\ Important note/highlight: This Team ID also have to be saved and committed into the repository. W/o that it'll only work in local but not on bitrise - make sure this change is committed into the repo.\\ How it should work for the user\\ Following the Getting Started guide should get the user to the point where there's a prepared Test ( primary ) as well as a Deploy ( deploy ) workflow, both passing the build. For iOS this requires Code Signing preps, and setting the Team ID is specific to flutter , as standard/native iOS projects start with that already set.\\ Additional resources/research (optional)\\ -\\ ",Closed,01/Apr/19 1:21 PM,,,,1,Technical Writing,Technical Writing,Completed Archive,14400,enhancement,,,,,,,,"01/Apr/19 1:28 PM;viktor.benei@bitrise.io;Feel free to ping me if you need more info/help with generating & preparing the sample.

2 The login button redirects the user over to the IdP using an address that contains custom parameters in the query string.
3 The IdP prompts the user to log in (or reuses an existing session if one exists) and sends the user back to the application via a second redirect.
4 The second redirect contains a code that the application extracts and exchanges for a token.
5 Using the API token, the application retrieves user information from the IdP.
6 At this point, the user is logged in to the application and can continue using it.

story,,j22m6,Storing and Sharing workflows among apps (tips),"Use case(s)\\ Unrelatedly, is there a standard/best practice for sharing a workflow across an organization? Right now I'm looking with some concern at the number of repositories we'll eventually be putting on Bitrise, and thinking that I'm going to want some way to manage them en masse rather than one at a time. My first and thus far only thought is to use a script to pull down the YML or something, but I figure I should probably ask if this is something that's already been dealt with successfully elsewhere.\\ Description\\ \\ How it should work for the user\\ That's a great question! 🙂Our build system and CLI provides great flexibility on handling workflows/bitrise.ymls. A few options (including the solution that you also mentioned):\\ - You can create a workflow and when you onboard new apps you can simply copy the yml of the app to the new one using the bitrise.yml tab of the Workflow Editor. The newly added apps would always have the latest config in this case, but the previously added apps would need to be updated manually if needed.\\ - You can store the bitrise.yml in the project's repo. This would mostly be similar to the previously mentioned method, but would add the ability to track the changes using your own source control system.\\ - You can store the bitrise.yml in a repository that would be used to keep every project's yml. This way you have the ability to track the changes to the ymls in a different repository and these changes wouldn't create extra noise in the project repository. You can create a common yml that can be called from within any other bitrise.yml and you can have the project specific ymls in their own folders.\\ \\ Also regarding the solutions where you store the yml a repository: you don't need to worry about editing the workflows manually as you can use our workflow editor using our CLI 🤓\\ \\ Let me know if you'd need any further info on any of these or do feel free to let us know if you have any other ideas! We love to hear new ways our users figure out to make better use of Bitrise 🤓\\ Key Results that need to be tracked\\ \\ Additional resources / research (optional)\\ ",Closed,13/Feb/19 10:35 AM,,,,2,Technical Writing,Technical Writing,Completed Archive,21600,enhancement,helps_support,,,,,,

bug,,3nnnd,"Update documentation on ""Grant access to a GitHub Organization"", GitHub's layout is changed.","User feedback:\\ ""The most confusing part is that some steps were accessing user settings, while others were accessing organization settings, and it wasn't clear which one I was supposed to be looking at for a particular step. I think Github has also updated their layout, so these instructions don't line up exactly. For example, step 4 says ""On the left side select Authorized applications""\\ \\ Here is the user settings page:\\ \\ And here is the organization settings page:\\ \\ I clicked on my best interpretation of ""On the left side select Authorized applications"". On the user page, Bitrise already had access, but on the organization settings page, the only option is to add a new OAuth app, which is not correct. Bitrise does not even show up in the list. This is where I got stuck yesterday.\\ \\ Instead, I was supposed to click on third-party access within the organization settings. That is explained towards the bottom of the link you sent, but I thought that I was so far off based on steps 1-6 that I gave up and asked for help.""\\ ",Closed,13/Feb/18 6:19 PM,,,,null,Technical Writing,Technical Writing,Completed Archive,,create_changelog,issue,,,,,,
