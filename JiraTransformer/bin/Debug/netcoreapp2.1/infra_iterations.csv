It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.\n\nAs your systems scale and become more complex, failure is inevitable, assessment and remediation is more involved and time-consuming, and it becomes increasingly painful to repeat recurring mistakes. Not having data when you need it is expensive.\n\nThe good news is, most organizations do have some kind of a post-mortem process in place to assess what happened once a service has been restored. Arguably, any resolution of an issue isn’t truly complete until a team has fully documented and reflected on it.\n\n(https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/post-mortem-incident-report/)\nMore details\nPagerDuty's postmortem feature is really neat, it guides you through the right things to collect, for smaller incidents it usually takes less than 30 minutes to collect all the data that will help us improve.\n",Open,1554279317335,"4/3/2019, 10:15:17 AM GMT+2",,,,,null,[],"[Gabor Takacs,Kristof Molnosi]",[maintenance],1,Infrastructure,Engineering,Iterations,5400000,1 h 30 m,{},[]
